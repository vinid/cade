# CADE

CADE is a tool to align distributional vector spaces. CADE is the more general name for our framework Temporal Word Embeddings with a Compass (TWEC).
TWEC was originally implemented by Valerio Di Carlo during his masters' thesis and published at the AAAI2019 Conference.

Eventually, we changed the name due to the more general nature of the alignment provided by the model.

CADE can and has been used for several different tasks: from general temporal vector space alignment [1]  and a more general comparison of language
variation [2], to tasks like semantic change detection [3,6] and narrative understanding [5].
